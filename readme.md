This is a updated version of Savsoft Quiz v5.0

<strong>Changes I made:</strong>
- Translated to Dutch (English template is still available)
- Updated the interface
- Remade some web pages

- Beautified some code
- New SQL import file
<br>
<br>
<strong>To do:</strong><br>
- Rewrite php code to connect to MYSQL database for php7/8 <br>
